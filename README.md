This repository demonstrates how to integrate **RESTful APIs** in a **Flutter** application using common HTTP methods like **GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE**. It provides a clean and structured approach to interact with APIs, handle responses, and manage state in a Flutter app. The project is designed to help developers understand how to connect their Flutter apps to backend services and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

---

## **Key Features**
1. **HTTP Methods:**
   - **GET:** Fetch data from the server.
   - **POST:** Send data to the server to create a new resource.
   - **PATCH:** Update an existing resource on the server.
   - **DELETE:** Remove a resource from the server.

2. **State Management:**
   - Uses **Provider** for efficient state management.
   - Ensures the UI updates dynamically based on API responses.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Proper error handling for network issues, invalid responses, and server errors.

4. **Clean Architecture:**
   - Separation of concerns with a clear structure for API services, models, and UI.

5. **Example API:**
   - Uses a mock or public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder) to demonstrate integration.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Flutter:** Framework for building cross-platform mobile applications.
- **Dart:** Programming language used for Flutter development.
- **HTTP Package:** For making HTTP requests to the API.
- **Provider:** For state management.
- **JSON Serialization:** For converting JSON data to Dart objects and vice versa.
